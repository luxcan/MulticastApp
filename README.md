# Multicast Sender/Receiver Application

This is a standalone console application that allows users to send and receive multicast packets over a network. The application can be configured to either send or receive messages based on user input. It is suitable for environments that discourage the use of Wireshark.

## Features

- List and select available IP addresses on the local machine.
- Configure multicast IP address and port.
- Switch between sender and receiver modes.
- Gracefully quit the application by pressing the `Esc` key.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later.
- **.NET Runtime**: The app is self-contained, so you do not need to install .NET separately.
